git commit -m "Helpful message"

commit often, push less often

margin: auto 

You must define a width

Vertical alignment:
	vertical-align: top | middle | bottom | baseline

position absolute is relative to its last parent that is not position: static


Programming
(finally)
syntax and semantics(what symbols mean)

Parser- program that reads code
Javascript YAY

JavaScript has very loose grammar, awkward typing, type coercion
	Functions are objects
	Event loop... Javascript has asynchronous functions, doesn't necessarily go line by line
	variables- named objects to which we can assign a value
		var name= "Rafi";
		assignment vs equality
	NEVER USE ==, equality is done with ===
	Encapsulate "code blocks" w/ curly braces
